## Abstract Factory Pattern
**Creational Pattern**
- __The factory creates one product__
- __Abstract Factory creates families__
- Enforces dependencies between classes
- Defers creation of objects to concrete subclasses
- Also knowns as __Kit Pattern__

> Example - Car Factories, One manufacturer per factory
> Each Factory can make multiple models, Need to support multiple manufacturers
